# Pre-push prose gate: reproduce CI's view of a submission branch before pushing.
#
# CI checks the PR body and changed notes against a tree containing ONLY
# committed files. This script runs the check inside a clean worktree of
# HEAD, so it fails exactly when CI would.
#
# Usage: [BASE=<remote>/main] [PR_AUTHOR=<login>] verify/prepush_prose_check.sh <pr-body-file>
#   The PR body must be given as a file; pass /dev/null if you have none yet.
#   Set PR_AUTHOR to your GitHub login to also reproduce CI's fieldnote
#   author-attribution check (every fieldnote added by the branch must
#   credit that handle in its frontmatter).
#   BASE defaults to upstream/main when an `upstream` remote exists and to
#   origin/main otherwise. In a fork, origin IS the fork, and its origin/main
#   is whatever the fork last synced (issue #2762): a stale one makes every
#   note in the repository look changed, and one ahead of upstream makes a
#   branch with broken citations look clean. Add the canonical repository as
#   `upstream`, or pass BASE explicitly.
#
# Exit 0 = safe to push. Anything else = fix the reported paths first.
