"""Run exact certification over codes/ and write a cert per code that closes.
A cert file certs/<slug>.json (d_exact=true) is what upgrades a code's
displayed tier to d=. Codes that do not close in budget simply get no cert
and stay at the self-certified upper bound. 2 workers, modest per-solve cap."""
