"""Guard the trust boundary for public code-submission PRs.

Code submissions are untrusted data. Verifier, schema, workflow, and site-builder
changes are trusted-code changes. A PR that changes both can otherwise submit a
code and weaken the code that validates it in the same diff.

Also enforces one NEW code per PR: the deep refutation gate spends ~10 minutes
per frontier code, so batched submissions would blow the CI budget or force a
shallower search per code.

Usage:
  python verify/check_submission_scope.py [--root PATH] [--base origin/main]
