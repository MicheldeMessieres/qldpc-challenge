"""
Tests for the transversal-gate claims of the circuit block (issue #1850,
stage 1): the verifier must ACCEPT a gate that preserves the stabilizer group
and induces the claimed logical action, and REJECT a claim that is wrong in
any one way -- a wrong action, a basis that is not symplectic, a permutation
that is not one, an S on a code whose X checks are not doubly even, a
claimed gate that fixes every logical operator.

Known-good claims come from textbook facts: the Steane code has transversal
H (X <-> Z) and S (X -> Y), any CSS code has a block-to-block CX, and the
[[4,2,2]] code's qubit swap 1 <-> 2 is a logical SWAP. Each is checked through
qldpc_verify.verify, the same path CI and the site take, so the claims also
exercise the schema. The site test renders one code page with verified gates.

Run: uv run pytest verify/test_transversal_gates.py
