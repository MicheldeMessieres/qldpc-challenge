"""Heuristic distance verification (random-information-set search).

Server-side, reproducible UPPER-BOUND search for a low-weight logical operator. It
sits between the witness upper bound (`d<=`, cheap CI) and exact certification
(`d=`, verify/certify.py), filling the gap for dense / high-rate codes that exact
IP cannot reach. Two outcomes:

  refuted      a logical lighter than the claimed distance was found -> the claim
               is over-stated; the true distance is <= the found weight.
  corroborated a large fixed-budget search found nothing lighter -> confidence
               beyond a single witness (NOT a proof; exact remains the only d=).

This is purely an upper-bound search: every method here only exhibits a logical of
some weight, i.e. tightens d <= w. It never proves a lower bound. The run is
reproducible (fixed seed + trial budget) and computed server-side, never trusted
from the submission.

Engine: random information set (QDistRnd-style). Canonical path is pure Python on
verify/gf2.py (no build). If the gf2_fast C++ extension is importable it is used
for a faster, larger overall weight search; witnesses are always extracted by the
Python path (the C++ returns weights only).

General stabilizer codes (code_type "stabilizer"): there are no
sides. The same RREF engine runs once on K = ker(B | A), the normalizer of
S = (A | B) written as Pauli vectors (x | z), scoring every candidate by its
Pauli weight |supp x union supp z| (a Y counts once) and testing nontriviality
by anticommutation with a logical basis of N(S) modulo S. The accelerator has no
Pauli-weight kernel, so the fast pass runs on the symplectic doubling
H'_X = (A | B), H'_Z = (B | A) (arXiv:2609.30069, eq. 12), a CSS code on 2n
qubits whose X-logicals are exactly the Pauli logicals of the original (a
Z-logical maps to one by swapping halves). Its Hamming weight over 2n bits is an
upper bound on the Pauli weight, so every proposal is re-scored by Pauli weight
in Python before it counts; d'_X = d'_Z by the half-swap symmetry, so one side is
enough. The verdict for a stabilizer code is reported under the single side "P".

Orbit-fold pass (2026-10-08 audit): before RIS, the code's symmetries are read
from the matrices (block-circulant shifts, 2-D shifts, multipliers; plus the
Tanner-graph automorphism group when pynauty is importable) and the lightest
logical constant on the orbits of each cyclic subgroup is searched in the
folded code, then lifted and re-validated on the full matrices. This is the
shape RIS cannot sample -- every 14th qubit of each block -- and it is how
54 board entries came to be over-stated. See orbit_fold_min_logical.

Usage: python verify/heuristic_distance.py codes/foo.json [--trials N] [--seed S]
       [--fold-trials F]; exit code 2 on a refuted claim (so it can gate if desired).

# Orbit-fold search: logicals that are constant on the orbits of a symmetry.
#
# RIS proposes supports of roughly uniform density, so it almost never lands
# on a logical whose support is a union of cosets of a shift subgroup -- and
# that is exactly the shape of the lightest logicals in the board's cyclic
# generalized-bicycle entries (every 14th qubit of each block on the
# [[700,26,100]] filing, found at weight 50 after the general battery had
# passed it; 54 entries were over-stated this way, audit of 2026-10-08).
#
# The fix is a change of search space, not of budget. For a qubit
# permutation g that preserves the stabilizer group and a cyclic subgroup
# <g^k>, a vector constant on the orbits of <g^k> is v = P x with P the
# n x c orbit-indicator matrix. It lies in ker(H) iff (H P) x = 0, and it is
# a nontrivial logical iff it anticommutes with some logical of the other
# type, i.e. (L P) x != 0. So the lightest orbit-constant logical is the
# lightest codeword of a code on c orbit-columns, weighted by orbit size --
# a much smaller problem that RIS (or exhaustion, when the folded kernel is
# tiny) solves in milliseconds. Every candidate is lifted and re-checked on
# the FULL matrices before it counts, so an incorrect symmetry can only waste
# time, never admit a false witness.
#
# Symmetries are read from the matrices, never from the family tag: block-wise
# cyclic shifts (n = blocks x L), 2-D shifts (L = l x m) and unit multipliers
# of a shift that was found. pynauty, when importable (research extra), adds
# the full automorphism group of the Tanner graph; the gate runs without it.

    ``trials`` is the pure-Python RIS budget per side; ``fast_trials`` is the
    gf2_fast accelerator's overall budget, used only when it exceeds ``trials``
    (the fast path reports weights, not witnesses, so it must out-search the
    Python pass to add anything). Pass ``fast_trials=0`` to disable the
    accelerator explicitly (refute_check does: the CI gate is pure Python with
    a fixed seed, so it stays deterministic). Any other skipped-accelerator
    combination warns on stderr -- see issue #290.

    ``fold_trials`` is the orbit-fold budget (RIS trials per folded code; see
    orbit_fold_min_logical). It runs first, under its own small wall-clock
    cap (_fold_seconds), so the RIS budget below is unchanged by it; pass
    ``fold_trials=0`` to skip it (the gate does, after running the fold at a
    larger budget as its own stage).
