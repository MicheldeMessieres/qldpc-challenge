"""A revision must not be reported as someone filing the same code twice.

A distance revision has the same checks as the entry it corrects, so it
fingerprints as an exact duplicate. That is right: `validate_candidate` is the
new-candidate path and a revision is not a new candidate. What was wrong is
what it said. "duplicate: identical to board entry X" is indistinguishable
from a double submission, so an agent that followed the audit loop, earned a
`redirect`, and packaged the revision was told its work was redundant and
discarded the most expensive data in the loop (issue #2583).

The fingerprint is deliberately unchanged. It is computed from the matrices
because the matrices are the code, and a claim about a code is not part of its
identity; widening it to include `d` would stop dedup catching a re-labelled
copy that claims a different distance, which is the case it exists for.

Everything here runs against the pinned fixture and a synthetic board, never
against `codes/`. Board data moves, and a test that reads it tests the board
rather than the rule (the lesson of #946 and #986). `refute=False` as well:
nothing here is about the distance search.
