"""
Tests for the circuit-tier refutation gate (RFC 0001 step 6, gate_changed):
an over-claimed d_circ must be caught by the bounded DEM search, an honest
claim must survive it, circuits/-only changes must still trigger the gate,
and unreadable artifacts must fail closed.

The over-claim fixture is organic: the default greedy schedule on the
[[25,1,5]] surface code has a hook error (true d_circ bound 3), and a
shallow 1-trial search returns a heavier valid witness -- exactly the
under-searched submission the gate exists to catch.

Run: uv run pytest verify/test_circuit_gate.py
