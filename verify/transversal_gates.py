Transversal-gate claims (issue #1850, stage 1): the GF(2) check behind
`circuit.gates`.

A transversal gate on a CSS code is a qubit permutation, optionally composed
with one single-qubit Clifford applied to every qubit (H or S), or a CX from
each qubit of one code block to a qubit of a second block. Every one of these
maps Paulis to Paulis, so its action is a linear map on symplectic vectors
(x | z) over GF(2), and the two facts a claim rests on are linear algebra:

  preserves   the image of every stabilizer generator lies in the stabilizer
              group (x-part in rowspace(H_X), z-part in rowspace(H_Z), per
              block). The gate is invertible on Paulis and the group is
              finite, so this is equality of groups, not containment. For S
              the GF(2) image cannot see the phase: S maps X on a support of
              weight w to i^w (XZ) on that support, so every X-check must
              have weight 0 mod 4 or the gate sends a stabilizer to minus a
              stabilizer and leaves the code space.
  action      the image of each logical generator, reduced modulo the
              stabilizers, equals the claimed product of logical generators
              exactly. The check is up to stabilizers only: a logical factor
              the gate introduces belongs in the claim's product list. The
              GF(2) image does not see phases, so S and S^dagger share a
              claim: the symplectic action is what the board can verify
              without trusting anything.

The submitter supplies the logical basis the claim is written in
(`circuit.logicals`, k X-type and k Z-type representatives with identity
pairing) and the verifier checks that basis first, so a claim cannot rest on
operators that are not logicals of this code. Nothing here ranks: a verified
gate is a listed property, a wrong claim fails verification.

Stage 2 (issue #2894) adds the `match` type: a W <= 2 diagonal layer, S on a
subset `support` of the qubits together with CZ on a disjoint `pairs`
matching (clifford "S"), or its Hadamard mirror, SHS on the subset with
CZ# = (H x H) CZ (H x H) on the matching (clifford "SHS"). The S family is
Z-diagonal and fixes every Z check exactly; the SHS family is X-diagonal
and fixes every X check. On the other side the GF(2) image of a check row
a is a itself plus a Z-part (a AND 1_support) XOR (P a), with P the
adjacency matrix of the matching, and that part must lie in the opposite
row space. The phase the GF(2) image cannot see has two sources: S sends
X_q to i X_q Z_q, one factor of i per supported qubit of a, and CZ sends
X_i X_j on a matched pair inside a to X_i Z_j X_j Z_i = -X_i X_j Z_i Z_j,
one factor of -1 per pair inside a. The image is +1 times a stabilizer iff

    |a AND support| + 2 #{(i, j) in pairs : a_i = a_j = 1}  ==  0  (mod 4),

which reduces to the uniform-S rule |a| == 0 (mod 4) when the support is
every qubit and there are no pairs. SHS sends Z_q to i X_q Z_q and CZ#
sends Z_i Z_j to -X_i X_j Z_i Z_j, so the SHS rule is the same count on the
Z-check rows; HSH, which sends Z_q to -i X_q Z_q, satisfies the same
congruence because 2p == -2p (mod 4). Checked against dense conjugation on
[[4,2,2]], the weight-6 [[6,4,2]] test code, and the Steane code (every
support, every matching) in test_transversal_gates.py.

`computed["action"]` in the report is the claim as the verifier accepted
it (sorted), not an independent recomputation: it is only populated when
the induced action matched the claim modulo stabilizers, so it is safe to
display and useless as an oracle for filling in a claim.
