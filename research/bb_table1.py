"""Bivariate bicycle (BB) codes from arXiv:2407.03973, Table 1.

"Logical Operators and Fold-Transversal Gates of Bivariate Bicycle Codes"
(Eberhardt, Smith, Varma). Table 1 lists ten codes C(c, d) on an l x m lattice
with their claimed [[n, k, d]]. Every row is reproduced here exactly, which is
what pins the convention below: a BB code on Z_l x Z_m has

    H_X = [ M(c) | M(d)^T ],   H_Z = [ M(d) | M(c)^T ]

with M(p) the sum, over the support of p, of the shift matrices for (i, j),
acting on the right on F_2[G]. l is the order of x and m is the order of y --
transposing the two changes the code, and getting it backwards silently yields
a valid-looking CSS code with the wrong k.

This module uses exactly the convention of research/kit/bb.py's build_bb, which
is what produced the submitted document, so build_from_table("128-14-12")
regenerates codes/128-14-12.json bit-for-bit. (The other common BB form,
[ M(c) | M(d)^T ] with [ M(d) | M(c)^T ], gives the same n, k, weight and
distance but a differently-labelled set of qubits, so the two are not
interchangeable when the submission is a specific matrix.)

The convention is pinned against the board's own baseline entry
codes/144-12-12.json (Bravyi et al., arXiv:2308.07915; A = x^3 + y^2 + y,
B = x^2 + x + y^3, orders (12, 6)): this form reproduces n = 144, rank 66 per
sector and k = 12 for that row, and it reproduces all ten of Table 1.

Nothing here computes a distance or asserts a track: verify/validate_candidate.py
decides both. Run this file directly to print the reproduction table.
