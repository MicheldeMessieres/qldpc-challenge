"""The support invariant must agree with brute force and with the paper's counts.

Three checks, all on codes small enough that nothing here is slow or pinned
to board data: the meet-in-the-middle kernel enumeration against a full
2^n sweep on the 18-qubit weighted-seed code; the paper's own numbers for
that code (38 minimum supports, minimum stabilizer weight 6, a weight-3
logical); and the automorphism count of the Steane code's incidence graph
(|PGL(3,2)| = 168) through whichever backend is installed.

Run: uv run pytest research/test_supports.py
