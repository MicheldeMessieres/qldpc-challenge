"""Check that two board entries are the same code up to a qubit permutation.

A WL-signature collision only flags a possible duplicate (issue #1650). This
settles the question for a pair when someone has exhibited the permutation: it
applies the permutation to the first entry's check matrices and tests that the
X and Z row spaces land exactly on the second entry's. Row-space equality is
the board's notion of "the same code": the stabilizer group, not the
particular generating set, so two files that differ by row operations and a
relabelling of qubits are one code.

Entries are read from git by blob hash rather than from codes/, so a record
stays checkable after the duplicate it names has been removed from the board,
and the citation cannot drift when a file is edited (issue #2643 cited a blob
that a later layout addition superseded; the matrices had not changed, but a
hash pins exactly what was checked). A negative control runs on every pair:
the same permutation with one transposition composed in must fail, which it
does unless the code has a nontrivial automorphism swapping those two qubits,
in which case the control is skipped and said so.
