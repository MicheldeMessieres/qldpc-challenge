# autoresearch quickstart

The minimal loop and the rules you may not break. Everything else is in
[`AUTORESEARCH.md`](AUTORESEARCH.md), the detailed manual; load the section you
need when you need it rather than all of it up front.

## Two rules

**No code is a "find" until `verify/validate_candidate.py` returns
`passed: true` for it.** The surrogate ranks candidates cheaply; it never
claims one. Never write your own distance check and never edit anything under
`verify/` — CI pins its hashes. If you think the gate is wrong, stop and tell
the human.

**A found low-weight logical is the most expensive data we produce — never
lose it.** Persist every candidate through `submit.make_submission` and
`submit.save_submission`, which embed the witness. An ad-hoc `python -c` that
prints a distance and exits throws away the part that cost the compute.

Unattended runs stage candidates in `research/candidates/` and stop there: no
writes to `codes/`, no commits, no PRs. A human decides what lands. Several
sessions stage there at once, so take a run directory from
`coordination.staging_dir()` rather than writing a flat `<n>-<k>-<d>.json`
another session is about to write too.

## The loop

```
  pick a direction ─▶ build (HX,HZ) ─▶ estimate distance ─▶ package ─▶ VALIDATE ─▶ stage
```

```bash
./qldpc recent --family <your family>    # what already landed, and what failed
./qldpc screened --family <your family>  # what was screened, at what depth, how it went
./qldpc targets                          # which track cells are open
```

```python
import sys; sys.path[:0] = ["research/kit", "verify"]
from bb import build_bb
from coordination import staging_dir
from surrogate import distance_rand
from submit import make_submission, save_submission

# gate: duplicate -- the board already holds this code. Keep in step with the
# paragraph below; research/test_documented_examples.py fails if the two disagree.
HX, HZ = build_bb(6, 6, [(3, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)], [(0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0)])
d = distance_rand(HX, HZ, trials=600)        # an upper bound, never a proof
doc = make_submission(HX, HZ, name=f"[[72,12,{d}]] my BB code",
                      construction="Bivariate bicycle on Z_6 x Z_6.",
                      authors=["your-handle"], family="bivariate-bicycle",
                      confidence="upper_bound")
path = f"{staging_dir()}/72-12-6.json"       # research/candidates/<run_id>/...
save_submission(doc, path)                   # refuses to clobber another session
print(path)
```

```bash
uv run --extra research python research/kit/coordination.py gate <the path it printed>
```

Exit 0 and `passed: true`, or it is not a find. The gate is the expensive step,
so screen widely and spend it only on survivors.

That command runs `verify/validate_candidate.py` unchanged and writes the
verdict it returned to `<the path>.verdict.json`, beside the candidate.
Running the gate script directly prints the same verdict and writes nothing,
so the evidence for a find lives in a scrollback and is gone with the
session; the witness in the candidate file is only half of what a reviewer
needs. In code, `coordination.gate_and_record(path)` does the same and
returns the verdict.

**The example above will not pass, and that is the point.** `[[72,12,6]]` landed
on the board long ago, so the gate exits 1 with `passed: false` and
`duplicate: identical to board entry 72-12-6.json`. Read the snippet as the
mechanics, not as a candidate. Most of the obvious constructions are already
taken, so expect to choose your own parameters before anything passes, and
treat `duplicate` as the gate working rather than as a bug.

Sweep a whole family with `search.py` instead of one code at a time. Repeat
until the budget is spent, then report the survivors with their honest labels:
`upper_bound`, "advances this board cell", novelty unverified.

## Record what you screened

A family you screened and dropped leaves nothing behind: the staging directory
is gitignored, so the next session pays for the same search again. The one
committed record is `./qldpc screened`, and it can only answer **at what depth**
if a run wrote the depth. `research/kit/campaign.py` is what writes it, and
nothing calls it on your behalf:

```python
from campaign import Ledger, load_campaign, write_summary

camp = load_campaign("research/campaigns/<id>/campaign.json")   # see below
led = Ledger(camp)
led.start_experiment("bivariate-bicycle", seed=7, mode="novel_generation",
                     params={"l": 6, "m": 6})
led.record_screen(trials=300_000, d=6, backend="fast")   # the depth
led.record_verdict("not_run")      # screened, dropped before the gate
led.end_experiment()
write_summary(led.summary(), "research/campaigns/<id>/summary.json")
```

`record_screen` is the one that matters: `trials` is the budget the number was
read at, and a screening depth read at one budget is not comparable to the same
depth read at another. `not_run` is the ordinary and useful verdict — it says
the member was screened and discarded before the gate.

Three prerequisites, all real. The ledger validates against a JSON schema, so
it needs the `research` extra — run it as
`uv run --extra research python your_script.py`, not a bare `uv run python`.
It needs a `campaign.json`; `campaign.scaffold_campaign` builds one, or copy
the smallest complete example —
`research/campaigns/smoke-bb-72/run.py` — or
[`campaigns/README.md`](campaigns/README.md), which documents the whole
contract. And a `summary.json` is what makes the run visible to the next
session; without one the work stays local.
