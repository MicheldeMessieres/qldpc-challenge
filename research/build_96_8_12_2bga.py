"""Rebuild the [[96,8,12]] two-block group-algebra code on D_4 x Z_6.

The code is a transcription, not a search result: the supports of `a` and `b`
are the ones printed for this code in Appendix J of arXiv:2610.05307v1 (the
`[[96,8,12]]` row of Table 1), and the parity checks follow that paper's
Eq. 1-2, `H_X = [L(a) | R(b)]` and `H_Z = [R(b)^T | L(a)^T]` on `G u G`.

Run it and it writes `codes`-shaped arrays to an .npz:

    uv run --extra research python research/build_96_8_12_2bga.py out.npz

`[[96,8,12]]` is the published parameter set; what the board gains is the
weight-8 placement (8 logical qubits at d = 12 in 96 qubits, where the board
held `[[104,8,12]]`). No search is involved, so the script has no seeds.
