"""Sweep the board's uncertified block-shaped entries with the annihilator attack.

The continuation issue #2706 asks for: every uncertified block-shaped entry
carries a recorded verdict from this attack at a stated budget, and the record
of who was run at what budget is committed so the next sweep can skip what
already held.

Selection is explicit rather than implied. An entry is a target when it has no
exact certificate and its blocklength is even, since an odd blocklength has no
two equal blocks for the attack to split. Entries already covered by a
committed audit are skipped unless --all is given, and the audit this run
writes lists them so the next one can do the same.
