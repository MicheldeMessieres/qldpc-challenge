"""Rotated toric code on an L x L torus, weight 4, k = 2, d = L.

The construction is the board's own `topological` family: every plaquette of the
periodic L x L lattice is a check, colored by ``(i + j) mod 2`` into the X block
and the Z block. See ``codes/900-2-30.json`` ("rotated toric code (30x30
torus)") for the filed instance of the family, and ``codes/784-2-28.json`` /
``codes/676-2-26.json`` for the rest of the ladder.

Qubits are indexed row-major, ``q(i, j) = i * L + j``, so qubit ``q`` sits at
grid position ``(q // L, q % L)``. Each plaquette is the unit square
``{(i, j), (i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1)}`` with both coordinates taken mod L.

Why k = 2: there are ``L^2`` plaquettes and ``L^2`` qubits, and the stabilizer
group has exactly two independent relations -- one among the X plaquettes and
one among the Z plaquettes -- so ``k = L^2 - (L^2/2 - 1) - (L^2/2 - 1) = 2``.

Why d = L: a full row (or column) of qubits is a logical operator of weight L,
and the code is the standard toric code, whose distance is the shortest
non-contractible cycle length, L. The claim filed here is only the upper bound
``d <= L``, certified by an explicit witness; the matching lower bound is the
standard topological argument of arXiv:quant-ph/9707021.

``planar_coordinates`` lays the code out on the unit grid with unit spacing for
the ``locality`` block. The torus's wrap-around edges put a check's support
diameter at ~2L, far past the radius-4 cap, so the code is ``unrestricted`` --
which is where the existing ladder entries sit.
