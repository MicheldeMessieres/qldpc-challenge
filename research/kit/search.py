"""A generic search funnel for *discovering* codes (the heart of autoresearch).

The constructors in this kit build one code at a time; this module sweeps a
*family* of them, screens each cheaply, and surfaces the best. The funnel is the
standard three stages:

    1. generate   candidate (HX, HZ) from a family (a sampler/enumerator)
    2. screen     skip k < min_k; estimate d with the surrogate; score by k*d^2/n
    3. rank       sort by efficiency and/or extract the Pareto frontier

The default path is pure numpy. ``surrogate.distance_rand`` also supports an
optional bit-packed C++ RIS backend (``backend="fast"`` or ``"auto"`` after
``make fast``). The screening distance is always an UPPER bound, so ``screen``
gives you ranked *candidates*, not certified codes. Confirm the finalists'
distance (``research/kit/distance.py``: exact MILP or decoder corroboration)
before claiming anything, then package the winner with ``submit.make_submission``.

``screen`` consumes any iterable of ``(label, HX, HZ)`` triples, so you can point
it at your own generator. Ready-made samplers ship for the BB family
(``sample_bb``) and the 2BGA families on dihedral, metacyclic, and affine
groups (``sample_dihedral``, ``sample_metacyclic``, ``sample_kasai_affine``);
a new one for any other family is the same shape.
