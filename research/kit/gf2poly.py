"""GF(2) polynomial arithmetic and the designed-divisor route to cyclic GB codes.

Every one of the board's 25 most efficient entries is a cyclic
generalized-bicycle code, H_X = [circ(a) | circ(b)] over Z_m with m near 340,
check weight 12 to 32, and none of them came from random supports (issue
#2778). For that family k = 2 deg gcd(a, b, x^m - 1), so a random pair of
supports has gcd 1 with x^m - 1 almost always and k = 2: measured at weight 12
on Z_315, Z_330, and Z_341, 150 of 180 random draws had k = 2 and none had
k above 12. The entries at the frontier instead pick a divisor g of x^m - 1
first, so that k is designed, and then look for sparse multiples of g to use
as a and b. ``research/cyclic_gb.py`` is the full search stack for that
route and needs sympy to factor x^m - 1; this module is the part a sampler
needs, with the factorization done here over GF(2) so the kit stays
numpy-only.

Polynomials are Python ints with bit i the coefficient of x^i, which makes
multiplication a shift-and-xor loop and keeps m = 341 well under a
millisecond per product.
