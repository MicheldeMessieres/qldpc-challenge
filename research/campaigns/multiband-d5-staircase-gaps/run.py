"""Re-derive and record the multi-band d=5 staircase-gap run.

Reproduces the search that produced the staged candidate, writes the screening
depth for every member that was measured, and records the two dead ends so the
next session does not pay for them again:

* **even patch size** (`d` = 4, 6, 8) is not a member of this family at all --
  every config is `css=False`, because the two-band plaquette colouring needs
  odd `d`. The `pitch_min(d) = 2*floor(3d/4)` law is therefore only ever
  extrapolated, never measured, at even `d`.
* **`rows=2, pitch=2`** looks like a clean advancing ladder (k = 2m-1 at
  n = 34m-9) but it is degenerate -- the bands overlap by seven rows, no patch
  argument constrains it -- and it collapses to d = 4 on both sides at 400k
  fast-backend trials. This is the fieldnote's "degenerate masks scored rank-g
  up to 5.5, every one refuted", reproduced.

A candidate is a find only when ``coordination.gate_and_record`` says
``passed: true``; everything here before that line is screening and triage.

Note the invocation: ``kit/campaign.py`` validates against a JSON schema, so it
needs ``jsonschema`` -- but NOT the whole ``research`` extra, which pulls
``pycryptosat``, a pinned version of which has no wheel for CPython 3.14 and
makes ``uv run --extra research`` fail outright on a 3.14 interpreter.
