"""The equivalence checklist box must not be answered by the candidate itself.

`qldpc submit` writes ``codes/<slug>.json`` and only then asks
``board_dedup`` whether the code is already on the board. Before the fix that
comparison included the file the run had just written, so every submission
matched itself on its own fingerprint: the box came out unticked naming
``<slug>.json``, and ``verify/check_prose.py`` -- which rejects an unticked box
-- refused the push. An unedited ``--open-pr`` draft could never complete.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix:

* the candidate's own entry is excluded, so a fresh run reports no match and
  the box is ticked with the evidence;
* a genuinely equivalent entry under a *different* name is still reported, so
  the exclusion does not become a way to file the same code twice.
