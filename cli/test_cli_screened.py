"""Tests for `qldpc screened`, the registry reader (issue #2726).

The command answers one question before a ladder is paid for: was this family
member already screened, at what depth, and how did it go. What is tested
here is that the question can be asked in one call, that a parameter query
narrows by subset rather than by exact document, and that a miss is reported
as a miss instead of as an empty success.
